##UFO Sightings Map

The first things we were curious about when it came to the UFO sightings data was where they were sighted. To get a better sense of this, we created a map showing each UFO sighting:


```{r , echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ufo_map

```
*(The data for Hawaii was excluded from the map in the interest of visibility.)*


```{r , echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ufo_shapes

```
